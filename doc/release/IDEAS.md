## I-011 · A song library pop-up instead of stepping the SONG field

- **From:** Radek, 2026-10-09: the LCD's SONG nn field steps through songs (click, drag, scroll). It should open a pop-up like the kit library instead: all songs with names, and load, copy, paste, clear and save from one place.
- **Scope:** both editors (MD 32 songs, MM 24). Same layout and keys as the kit library.
- **Status:** planned, after 0.3.5.

## I-010 · Monomachine: note length like Ableton/Digitakt

- **From:** Discord tester C, 2026-10-08: dropping notes in the MM piano roll, a note runs until the next one; wants explicit trig/note length (place 1/16, then 1/8 notes as in Ableton).
- **Status:** new.

## I-009 · Option to turn off the "kit has unsaved edits" warning on pattern change

- **From:** Discord tester C, 2026-10-08 (mostly the Machinedrum, maybe the Monomachine too).
- **Status:** new.

## I-008 · The editor menu in the editor's own style (next, after 0.3.4)

- **From:** Radek, 2026-10-08.
- **Idea:** the right-click / editor menu (GUI Scale, Page Zoom, RAM recording, Updates) is JUCE's default dark-blue menu. Draw it in the page with the themed menu from the key map (deskMenu.js): plate colours and fonts, light/dark and MK1/MK2, the same in every DAW and OS. First line "Machinedrum Editor <version>"; Performance diagnostics into a Developer submenu.
- **Status:** planned as the next task after 0.3.4 (option A or a recoloured native menu, B — to decide).

## I-007 · Ableton-style editing on the Monomachine piano roll

- **From:** Discord tester C, 2026-10-08.
- **Idea:** B toggles draw mode on the piano roll (as in Ableton); box-select notes.
- **Status:** new; fits the keyboard-map port to the Monomachine (K7).

## I-005 · Update from inside the app (after 0.3.2)

- **From:** Radek, 2026-10-07.
- **Idea:** the standalone app checks `https://mdmm.dev/latest.json` (once a day, can be turned off; no third-party server), shows "Update available", downloads the new version, verifies it with our own signature (ed25519, independent of Apple/Microsoft), replaces the app and the VST3/AU/CLAP plug-ins and restarts. Plug-ins in a DAW only show a note ("open the app to update"). macOS, Windows (swap after exit; a DAW must be closed for plug-ins) and Linux. A system-wide install asks for the password once.
- **Status:** built on `feat/updates` (2026-10-08), design in [DESIGN-updates.md](../modern-ux/DESIGN-updates.md). As built: the standalone installs (macOS: opens the .pkg in the Installer; Windows, Linux: swaps the app after exit); the plug-ins are never replaced by the app (a DAW may have them loaded). Installs wait for the update key ([SIGNING.md](SIGNING.md)).

## I-004 · The site and latest.json update themselves on release (after 0.3.2)

- **From:** Radek, 2026-10-07.
- **Idea:** when a release is published, a GitHub workflow writes the version into `site/public/config.js` and `site/public/latest.json` and deploys the site. Download links already follow `releases/latest/download/<fixed name>`.
- **Needs:** one Cloudflare API token (Workers edit on the NativeKloud account only) saved as a GitHub secret — Radek.
- **Status:** built on `feat/updates` (2026-10-08): `.github/workflows/mdmm-site-release.yml`. Needs the secrets in [SIGNING.md](SIGNING.md) (update key, Cloudflare token).

## I-003 · Follow the last played track (external MIDI controller)

- **From:** Discord tester B, 2026-10-07.
- **Idea:** an option to switch the selected track (instrument focus) to the one last played from an external MIDI controller.
- **Status:** new.

## I-002 · Show incoming notes on the Sound page

- **From:** Discord tester B, 2026-10-07.
- **Idea:** a visual sign on the Sound page when a note arrives from a MIDI controller (which track was triggered).
- **Status:** new.

## I-001 · Select steps, copy, paste and duplicate

- **From:** Discord tester A, 2026-10-07: "copy only one step and paste it, same track".
- **Idea:** select one or more steps with a modifier-drag; copy, cut, paste, duplicate, delete.
- **Status:** being built (`feat/step-selection`).
